# mini-factory-twin
An AI-driven factory twin modelling a manufacturing assembly line that learns to optimize throughput and maintenance scheduling in real time using RL / physics.

Project Progress:
Sprint 1: Built simple MVP to get the project up and running. Implemented basic back-end using FastAPI for RESTful API quickly (via Uvicorn, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy), connecting the gymnasium based RL simulation to the PostgreSQL database. Built a React based frontend using Three.JS for 3-D visualization for a clean UI of the simulation.
    Have a lot of work to do, mainly in understanding the physcis and fleshing it out to become more complex/dynamic, to allow for understandings of real factory processes and hopefully see some interesting RL.
